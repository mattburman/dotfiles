# My config files

This repo contains config for various things for a macOS setup.

# dotbot

Dotbot is makes it easier to install dotfiles
by taking a `install.conf.yaml` of symlinks and creating them,
and running shell commands

# Configured
## (.) karabiner.edn

This file configures `yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo`
which configures `tekezo/Karabiner-Elements` in a nice `.edn` format
You need to make sure karabiner-elements has a profile named `Goku` and that it is selected.

## Brewfile

This is a list of apps that I use to be installed on any fresh builds
Install via `brew bundle`
I have an appetite to move to Nix but this is what I have for now

## LaunchDaemons
This directory contains LaunchDaemons with it's own README on how to configure
